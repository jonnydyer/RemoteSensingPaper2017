- Why is SkySat-1 so good and how did we make it that way?
    - Performance?  Sort of...
    - Cost?  Maybe (see below)...
    - Integration?  Probably...
- Need to measure things to get better!
    - Axis of improvement:
        - Cost / Capital Req'd
        - Volume of Data
            - Scale up vs. Scale out
        - Value of Data
            - Not just IQ
                - Timeliness, responsiveness, reliability
                - Product quality, usability, traction, uptake (stuff around the pixels)
                - Context / meta
            - Value added products
- Cost
    - Do pie charts for SS-1, SS-2, SS-C1, SS-C13
    - NRE
    - Launch
    - Optics
    - BOM
    - I&T
    - Overhead
    - Economies of Scale and Fractionation
    - Scaling of each contributor (vs. number, size, etc)
- Optical scaling
	- Rayleigh
	- SNR / px
	- Sampling / Q
- Mass (area / volume)
- Power
	- Solar array area
	- Batteries
- Information theoretical
    - Image data collection / value
        - Compare to space RF receivers - shorter wavelength = more value?
	- Communications
		- Antenna size
		- Power
	- Pixel processing / storage
    - Attitude knowledge
- Actuators
    - Attitude control (rotational)
    - Propulsion
- Radiation and electronics shielding
