@article{fiete_blur,
	Abstract = {Space-based high-resolution scanning array imaging systems have the potential to introduce large amounts of image smear. When designing these systems, it is useful to understand how smear will degrade image quality. A brief description of the causes of smear and a simple mathematical model are presented. A series of image simulations (for a system in which λFN/p=1.0, where λ is the mean wavelength for a panchromatic system, FN is the system f number, and p is the pixel pitch of the detectors) are performed in which along scan smear (ranging from 1.0 to 8.0 pixels) is introduced. Using the National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS), expert observers rated ΔNIIRS difference in image quality between the images with simulated smear and the original ``unsmeared'' image. The functional relationship between smear error and image quality (in units of ΔNIIRS) is determined. {\copyright} 1999 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

@article{fiete_Q_IQ,
	Abstract = {Commercial remote sensing systems generally employ a linear detector array for imaging the ground scene. Strategies for increasing the ground sampling along one direction of the array can be employed to improve the image quality. Image simulations were generated to quantify the image quality improvement, in terms of the National Image Interpretability Scale (NIIRS), as the sampling is increased in the along-scan (A/S) direction of the array. The simulations modeled a remote sensing system with λFN/p=1 (where FN is the system f-number and p is the detector sampling pitch) and show that an image quality improvement of approximately 0.35 NIIRS can be achieved if the sampling rate is increased in the A/S direction by 2×. {\copyright} 1999 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

@article{fiete_snr_IQ,
	Abstract = {Different definitions of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are being used as metrics to describe the image quality of remote sensing systems. It is usually not clear which SNR definition is being used and what the image quality of the system is when an SNR value is quoted. This paper looks at several SNR metrics used in the remote sensing community. Image simulations of the Kodak Space Remote Sensing Camera, Model 1000, were produced at different signal levels to give insight into the image quality that corresponds with the different SNR metric values. The change in image quality of each simulation at different signal levels is also quantified using the National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS) and related to the SNR metrics to better understand the relationship between the metric and image interpretability. An analysis shows that the loss in image interpretability, measured as ΔNIIRS, can be modeled as a linear relationship with the noise-equivalent change in reflection (NEΔρ). This relationship is used to predict the values that the various SNR metrics must exceed to prevent a loss in the interpretability of the image from the noise. {\copyright} 2001 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

@article{fiete_q,
	Abstract = {The ratio of the sampling frequency to the optical bandpass limit of an incoherent diffraction-limited optical system is a fundamental design parameter for digital imaging systems. This ratio is denoted by λFN/p, where λ is the mean wavelength, FN is the system f/number, and p is the detector sampling pitch. The value of λFN/p for a remote sensing system can have a profound impact on the image quality and the utility of the acquired images. The interaction between λFN/p and image quality is sensitive to the system design parameters such as modulation transfer function (MTF), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and ground sampled distance (GSD). Image simulations and analysis are presented that illustrate the changes in image quality as a function of λFN/p. System design trades that may influence the determination of the optimal λFN/p for a remote sensing system are also discussed. {\copyright} 1999 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},
